        console.log("My name is :",name);
        console.log("My age is : ", age);
        console.log("the addition = :",sum);
        console.log("the subtraction =:",sum - 5 );
        // we use let keyword for variable because it's mutable for eg;
        let varname= "satyam";
        console.log(varname);
         varname = "shivam";
        console.log(varname);
        // NOTE -> here if we see the output it's gonna print 1)satyam 2)shivam so here it can overwrite values where as const keeps the value first assigned as the constant value for that variable.
        // NOTE -> now the another keyword var is same is let they both are mutable the only difference between the two is that let is a local variable whereas var is a global variable.
        // js is case sensitive
